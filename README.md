# Tic Tac Toe:

This application allows a user to play Tic Tac Toe in their browser.  I wanted to do this project to test my newly learned programming skills.

## Planning Story

For this project we were tasked with building the client side for a tic tac toe game. I knew that I wanted to keep my project as minimalistic as possible when the end user views it, so I mocked up a quick wireframe that was simple yet still accomplished the goals that I needed.  When it came to designing the board in HTML I opted to use bootstrap classes to arange my gameboard and Javascript to power the "brains" of the game. The API that the game accesses was provided for us and you can read about it in the link above.

### User Stories
- As a user I would like to be able to sign in/up/change password/sign out.
- As a user I would like to be able to start and play tic tac toe.
- As a user I would like to only be able to only make valid moves.
- As a user I would like a message to be displayed when someone has won.
- As a user I would like to be able to restart my game after its over.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS/SASS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Would like to eventually allow a user to pick their own playabe pieces instead of X and O. I would also like to make the site look slightly better for the end user.
