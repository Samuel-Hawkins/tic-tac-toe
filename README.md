# Tic Tac Toe:

This application allows a user to play Tic Tac Toe in their browser.  I wanted to do this project to test my newly learned programming skills.

## Planning Story



### User Stories
- As a user I would like to be able to sign in/up/change password/sign out.
- As a user I would like to be able to start and play tic tac toe.
- As a user I would like to only be able to only make valid moves.
- As a user I would like a message to be displayed when someone has won.
- As a user I would like to be able to restart my game after its over.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Would like to eventually allow a user to pick their own playabe pieces instead of X and O. I would also like to make the site look slightly better for the end user.
